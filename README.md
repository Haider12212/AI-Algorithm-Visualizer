## Introduction

Understanding algorithms can sometimes be challenging, especially for beginners. This visualizer aims to simplify the learning process by providing an interactive environment where users can observe how different algorithms explore and solve problems step by step.

## Installation

To use the visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the main script using `python main.py`.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with a graphical interface where you can choose the algorithm you want to visualize and interact with the visualization.

- **Select Algorithm:** Choose from the available algorithms (BFS, DFS, Greedy Best-First Search, A*, Hill Climbing).
- **Adjust Parameters:** Depending on the algorithm, you may have options to adjust parameters such as start and end points, obstacles, etc.
- **Run Visualization:** Initiate the visualization to see how the selected algorithm progresses and solves the problem.
- **Interact:** Depending on the algorithm, you may be able to interact with the visualization by adding obstacles, changing start or end points, etc.

## Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is another algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Greedy Best-First Search

Greedy Best-First Search is a search algorithm which explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule.

### A* Search

A* Search is a widely used pathfinding algorithm that uses a heuristic to efficiently find the shortest path between two points.

### Hill Climbing

Hill Climbing is a mathematical optimization technique that belongs to the family of local search algorithms. It repeatedly makes small changes to a candidate solution and compares them to the current solution.
